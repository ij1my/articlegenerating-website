    Trim and physically fit at 70 years old, his hair and beard whitened by time, the man
with a gentle face moved at a steady pace. He looked like a loving grandfather on his way to
bring a present to his grandchildren. At least, that’s what anyone would think seeing him
walk down the streets of the city, with his dark suit, a leather briefcase in his right hand.
But the truth is different. The man didn’t have a present for anyone. His briefcase hid a
bomb—that is, a “bomb” in the form of the news he was carrying. It was news that would
shake public opinion around the world and stir up controversy. As the news spread, a lot of
people thought the old fellow was crazy. Others believed that he was engaged in an exercise
of self-promotion. At any rate, Ernie Chambers, independent state senator in Nebraska, was
known as an old, argumentative, and irreverent politician.
On that morning of September 14, 2007, senator Chambers went into the Douglas
County courthouse and filed a lawsuit against God. He demanded that God stop causing so
much terror in the world.
In the petition that he filed the African-American attorney who had never practiced law
accused God of causing “fearsome floods, egregious earthquakes, horrendous hurricanes,
terrifying tornadoes, pestilential plagues, ferocious famines, devastating droughts, genocidal
wars, birth defects and the like.” He said the Deity was responsible for “calamitous
catastrophes resulting in the widespread death, destruction and terrorization of millions upon
millions of the earth’s inhabitants including innocent babes, infants, children, the aged and
infirm without mercy or distinction,”
1 and he asked the court for an injunction ordering God
to cease and desist.
Strange or quixotic though it may appear, Chambers’ lawsuit against God shows at
least two things: the irreverence of modern humanity, and more significantly, the anxiety that
millions of people feel today because of the terrifying events taking place all around them.
Strange things are, indeed, happening to our planet.
